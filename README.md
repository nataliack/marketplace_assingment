# Problem

The fashion industry is expanding, with new brands coming into competition and everyone trying to get their clothing brands to become popular is much harder. Basically, this problem needs solving because the clothing market is beginning to overflow with so many categories of clothes sold all together making it harder to find something that everyone will appreciate. 

# Ideas/Solution
## marketplace app overview:


A marketplace app that is dedicated to loungewear. The app will only sell things like sweat shirts, sweatpants, socks, etc, overall things that are comfy. The idea is that there will be categories like vintage sweater sets from different decades or new loungewear brands made by anyone. There would be three different entities: the buyer/customer, the seller and the manufacturer. 
The buyers will buy things from the seller - who will need to provide who the manufacturer is and where the clothes are sourced from. this will be a good way to know if clothes are eco-friendly. 
The seller can buy loungewear in quantity from the manufacturer. But the seller can also be a manufacturer and sell clothes directly to buyers. If the person is just a seller, then they can choose to buy from manufacturers offered by the app to sell or sell second-hand loungewear such as vintage sweaters or sweatpants.  
If someone chooses to only be a manufacturer, then they are the ones who make whatever clothes the seller wants to buy. This is a good way to join manufacturers who truly appreciate quality and eco-friendly clothes. There will be two options/types of manufacturers: if youâ€™re a factory or a non-factory and are just a one person seamstress or a small group of seamstresses. This also gives opportunities and a new way for seamstresses around the world to earn income. 

# Target audience 

Target audience would be anyone who appreciates comfort and loungewear. It can also be individuals who are interested in becoming business owners, Influencers or musicians who are wanting to release merch, upcoming designers. This application would also attract any individuals who prefer to shop eco-friendly or mindfully sourced clothes as well as people who love vintage loungewear like sweatshirts. Another target audience would be seamstresses from around the world who are looking for more jobs.  

# Functionality and features
